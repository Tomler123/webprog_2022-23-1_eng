# Exercises 2

**This week's topic: introduction to DOM, basic event handling**

1. Place a button with caption **Say Hello** on an HTML page. When the button is clicked, make it disappear and show the text **Hello world!** in big letters!

2. Generate a target integer between 0 and 100. (Help: `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`) Place a number input on the page where we can guess the target. The script should respond whether our guess is correct, smaller or greater than the target.

3. Show an image on the page, whose URL is given in a text field.

4. List (as `ul`) all hyperlinks on a page when the page finishes loading.

5. Create a page that contains a balance display (e.g. $1000), an input field and a button. When the button is pressed, deduct the amount in the field from the balance. Check the field's content on every `input` event, and if it's not a number (or it's greater than our balance) make the field's background red:
    - manually by setting the `background-color` property
    - by adding a premade `error` class

6. Place three input fields above a table. When a button is clicked, insert the values of these fields into the table as a new row and reset the fields to empty.

7. Read a positive integer `N` and generate a multiplication table from `1x1` to `NxN`.
